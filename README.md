     Your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast.

        1. Pass input image folder and output folder as arguments
        2. Convert images to standard RBG
        3. Rotate the image 90° clockwise
        4. Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
        5. Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format
