Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate 
                     Final Project

Project 1, Image Processing:
    Project Problem Statement:
     Your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast.
    Task:
     Write a script that processes a bunch of image meeting the following criteria. 
        1. Pass input image folder and output folder as arguments
        2. Convert images to standard RBG
        3. Rotate the image 90° clockwise
        4. Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
        5. Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format

Project 2, Web Data Processing: 
    Project Problem Statement: 
     Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company’s website. To do this, you’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company’s website (currently using Django)
    Task:
     Write a script that processes the feeback collected and uploads feedback to a website meeting the following criteria.
        1. Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files 
        2. Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
        3. Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
        4. Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
    Results:

        [Bash Script](Web_data_processing\web_data_processing.sh)
        [Powershell Script](Web_data_processing\web-data-processing.ps1)
        [Java Script](Web_data_processing\WebDataProcessing)

Project 3, Email Processing:
    Project Problem Statement:
     You work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.
    Task:
     Write a script that automatically generates a PDF and sends it by email meeting the following criteria.
        1. Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
        2. Generate a PDF using Python
        3. Automatically send a PDF by email 
    Results:
        [Python Script](Email_processing\python\cars.py)
